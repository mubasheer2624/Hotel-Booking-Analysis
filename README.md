# Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover patterns in booking behaviors and predict cancellations. The main goal is to identify which bookings are more likely to be canceled, assisting hotel management in optimizing their strategies and improving customer retention. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.

# Data Description
The dataset contains several attributes related to hotel bookings, including booking dates, stay duration, the number of guests, country of origin, and whether the booking was canceled. The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and remove illogical entries.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase includes:

Visualization of outliers in booking lead times and rates.
Analysis of guest distribution by country using choropleth maps.
Trends in guest arrivals over months and years across different hotel types.
Examination of room pricing per person and booking frequencies for different room types.
Market segmentation analysis to identify trends in successful and canceled bookings.
Predictive Modeling
After EDA, predictive models are developed to forecast booking cancellations:

Feature engineering is performed to encode categorical variables and normalize the data.
Machine learning models such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are evaluated using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
The final model's performance is evaluated using an accuracy score and a confusion matrix.

# Results
The analysis provides insights into booking patterns and cancellation trends, with the final model achieving high accuracy in predicting cancellations. These insights are valuable for devising strategies to reduce cancellation rates and enhance customer satisfaction.
